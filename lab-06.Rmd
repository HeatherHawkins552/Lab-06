### Load packages and data

```{r load-packages, message = FALSE}
library(tidyverse) 
library(dsbox)
library(mosaicData) 
```

### Exercise 1

```{R reading}
staff <- read_csv("data/instructional-staff.csv")

#Turning into a longer data frame
staff_long <- staff %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = -faculty_type, names_to = "year") %>%
  mutate(value = as.numeric(value))

#Plotting long data
staff_long %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = value, color = faculty_type)) +
  geom_line()

#Fixing data points
staff_long %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = year,
             y = value,
             group = faculty_type,
             color = faculty_type)) +
  geom_line()+ labs(title="Instructional Staff Employment Trends ", subtitle="American Association of University Professors (AAUP)",
   x="Year", y="Number of Hires", color="Faculty Type")
```

### Exercise 2

Suppose the objective of this plot was to show that the proportion of part-time faculty have gone up over time compared to other instructional staff types. > What changes would you propose making to this plot to tell this story?

I would group all of the other groups (Full-Time Non Tenure, Full-Time Tenure-Track, Full-Time Tenured, and Grad Student Employees) data together, and compare that data to the Part-Time data within the graph. 

```{R Staff}
staff_compare <- staff_long %>%
  subset(faculty_type!="Part-Time Faculty")

staff_compare<- staff_compare %>%
  group_by(year)%>%
  summarise(mean_pct=mean(value),
            faculty_type="other_types")

pt_faculty <- staff_long %>%
  subset(faculty_type=="Part-Time Faculty")

#Plotting
staff_compare %>%
  ggplot()+ geom_line(data=pt_faculty,aes(x = year,
           y = value,
           group = faculty_type,
           color = faculty_type))+
geom_line(data=staff_compare,aes(x = year,
           y = mean_pct,
           group = faculty_type,
           color = faculty_type))+ labs(title="Instructional Staff Employment Trends ", subtitle="American Association of University Professors (AAUP)",
   x="Year", y="Number of Hires", color="Faculty Type")
```

### Exercise 3

Can you help them make improve it? First, brainstorm how you would improve it. Then create the improved visualization and document your changes/decisions with bullet points. It’s ok if some of your improvements are aspirational, i.e. you don’t know how to implement it, but you think it’s a good idea. Implement what you can and leave notes identifying the aspirational improvements that could not be made.

To improve the fisheries graph, we could plot the data with a cap scale- since there are only a few countries that farm and capture an enormous amount of fish. 

Or maybe even focus on the TOP countries that farm and capture fish. 
Since this Lab is about converting data and comparing, Ill focus on the second method


```{R Fish}
fisheries <- read_csv("data/fisheries.csv")

fisheries_long <- fisheries %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = -country, names_to = "Fishing_Type") %>%
  filter(Fishing_Type %in% c("capture", "aquaculture")) %>%
  mutate(value = as.numeric(value))

#Plotting

fisheries_long %>%
  filter(country %in% c("China", "Indonesia", "India", "Vietnam", "United States")) %>%
  ggplot(aes(group = Fishing_Type, color= Fishing_Type, y=value, x=country)) + labs(title="Tons of Fish Produced by Top Fishing Countries ",
   x="Countries", y="Number of Fish by Tons", color="Fishing Types")+   geom_line()


```
